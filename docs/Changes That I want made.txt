Changes that I want made:
1) make all fonts i used in the Palette consistent with those used between the labels and the feild contents.
2) Change the label and the name of the associated input field from 'Mode' to 'Data source'.
3) disable all input fields until a Data Source is selected.
4) when a 'data source' is selected only enable the input fields that relate to that type of source.
5) when parsing input data in JSON format, use the data tagged as either "rt", "T", or "t" as temperature data, whichever is encountered first in the input.
